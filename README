;; TelnetLib
;; =========
;; In our ordinary work, we often write some automatically scripts
;; which login in the server to run some commands and performce some
;; actions based on the result of the commands. In this case, a telnet
;; client library will be very helpful. Such a library is very handy
;; in Perl, Python and Ruby. But I googled it a lot and failed to find
;; one in Common Lisp. So I decided to port the Telnetlib from Python
;; to Common Lisp. Why port from Python? Because I am more familiar
;; with Python and have use its TelnetLib before :-) 
;;
;; The functionality of this library is almost the same as Python's
;; one.  But the interface is a little different.


;; Supported Lisp implementations
;; ==============================
;; - SBCL
;; - LispWorks
;; - Allegro CL
;; - CLISP
;;
;; TelnetLib also supports other Lisp implementations (require USOCKET
;; and FLEXI-STREAMS) . But I have never done any testing for them.

;; Testing:
;; --------
;; TelnetLib has been tested in following environment:
;;   - sbcl-1.0.11-x86-linux
;;   - LispWorks in Windows XP
;;   - Allegro CL in Windows XP
;;   - CLISP 2.43 in Linux
;;   - CLISP 2.41 in Windows XP
;;
;; But it failed in sbcl-1.0.9 in Windows XP. Error occurs
;; when writing the socket stream.


;; Library Dependency
;; ==================
;; For SBCL, LispWorks, Allegro CL and CLISP, it only depends on
;; CL-PPCRE.
;; For other Lisp implementations, USOCKET and FLEXI-STREAMS (to
;; set the external-format) are also required.

;; Known Problem
;; =============
;; Don't work well when telent localhost. It seems it is due to the process/thread
;; schedule mechanism. Will try to fix it in the future.

;; How to use it
;; =============
